Treat the live repository as authoritative if it has advanced beyond this commit.


## Prerequisite

Run only after two independent qualified humans have genuinely completed the required review packet and a separate adjudicator is available.

If genuine rows are absent, do not modify evidence. Produce a blocker report and stop.

## Mission

- ingest genuine review exports;
- verify attestations, identities, coverage and blinding;
- compute agreement and diagnostics;
- build the disagreement queue;
- ingest genuine adjudication;
- pass canonical C10;
- exclude invalid items through a versioned decision;
- freeze Compact-20;
- register all review evidence and hashes;
- create live-run approval packet.

## Rules

- never auto-fill;
- never infer missing judgments;
- never convert fixture rows;
- never expose public identities;
- every amendment must remain in the audit log;
- failed C10 produces a new review version, not weakened thresholds.

## Outputs

- audited review report;
- agreement report;
- exclusion register;
- C10 certificate;
- frozen slice;
- registry records;
- evidence graph;
- reviewer-resource measurements;
- exact next live calibration command.

## Validation

Run all human, C10, split, contamination, registry and Level-5 gates.

## Acceptance State

`COMPACT20_C10_PASSED_AND_SLICE_LOCKED`

## Global Non-Negotiable Rules

Do not:

- fabricate human judgments, adjudication, trajectories, scores, timings, model results, external replications or user feedback;
- pass C10 using fixtures, AI review, blank rows or proxy review;
- enable real model execution unless the phase explicitly authorises it and every prerequisite passes;
- expose or commit private task text, answers, intervention payloads, reviewer identities or evaluator-only metadata;
- add a parallel replacement for a canonical system that already exists;
- weaken tests or gates merely to make the build pass;
- use benchmark outputs to redesign confirmatory tasks after outcomes are known;
- run Main-scale experiments before Scale and transfer evidence justify expansion;
- use paid APIs unless explicitly authorised;
- force-push, rewrite Git history, create a branch or open a pull request;
- stage unrelated user-owned work;
- claim Level 5 merely because code exists.

Always:

- inspect before building;
- extend canonical modules;
- use typed schemas and explicit states;
- fail closed;
- preserve raw evidence outside Git;
- use content hashes and immutable provenance;
- separate `DESIGN_ONLY`, `ENGINEERING_ONLY`, `FIXTURE_ONLY`, `HUMAN_INPUT_REQUIRED`, `PRELIMINARY_REAL_EVIDENCE`, `AUDITED_REAL_EVIDENCE` and `PAPER_ELIGIBLE_EVIDENCE`;
- add focused tests before broad validation;
- keep a live ledger and resumable handoff;
- measure actual runtime when executing and label projections honestly;
- push only public-safe, intentional changes.

## Git Publication Contract

At the beginning:

```bash
cd /Users/saketmaganti/Projects/causal-agent-bench
git status --short
git status --branch --short
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
git remote -v
git fetch origin main
git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main
```

Remain on `main`. Preserve every pre-existing user-owned tracked or untracked path.

Before commit:

```bash
git diff --check
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Stage explicit task-owned paths only. Never blindly stage a mixed worktree.

Push:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Never force-push.

Verify:

```bash
LOCAL_HEAD="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
REMOTE_HEAD="$(git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main | awk '{print $1}')"
test "$LOCAL_HEAD" = "$REMOTE_HEAD"
```

Observe remote CI with a bounded wait. Fix deterministic repository defects, but do not change external repository settings without authorisation.


Preferred commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Lock CAB Compact-20 after genuine human validation"
```

Commit only public-safe aggregate reports, hashes and policies. Keep reviewer identities and protected payloads private.
